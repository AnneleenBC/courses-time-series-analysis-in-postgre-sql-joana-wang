Now that you have your data converted into a date format you can go ahead and use it!
In this chapter we are going to explore how to use parts of a date and which ones you can extract.

## Your Timestamps

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ce058e1bbd"
```

`@part1`
A timestamp will have the full date and time elements, however sometimes you might just want to use a specific part of it.

What if you'd like to see your data only 
- by year?
- by day?
- by hour of the day?

## DATE_PART() Function

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "681abd6a95"
```

`@part1`
Dates are very versatile and there's a function that allows you to do just that!

```SQL
DATE_PART(<part to extract>, <timestamp>)
```{{1}}
Here is an example of the possible results of DATE_PART():{{2}}

You can pick and choose which specific part to use!{{4}}

## All the Date Parts

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "3bdf6d6b62"
```

`@part1`
There are many parts that you can extract out of a timestamp as you see them:{{1}}
- year{{2}}
- month{{2}}
- day{{2}}
- hour{{2}}
- minute{{2}}
- second{{2}}


`@part2`
There are even others that you may not see but are contained within the original date such as:{{3}}
- millennium{{4}}
- century{{4}}
- decade{{4}}
- week{{4}}
- day of the year (doy){{4}}
- day of the week (dow){{4}}

## Using DATE_PART()

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d4ccb14fde"
center_content: true
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
Let's look at an example. If you wanted to find out the day of the week out of a date, you could write:
```SQL
SELECT my_timestamp,
DATE_PART('dow', my_timestamp) AS day_of_the_week
FROM my_dates
```{{1}}

Notice that the day_of_the_week does not say Monday, Tuesday, etc?{{2}}

## Using DATE_PART()

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e3e7850302"
```

`@part1`
When using DATE_PART, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:
- The result of a DATE_PART function is a **number**.
- The part that you want to extract needs to be **in quotes**.


In this example we extracted 'dow' (day of the week) and by default they are mapped from 0-6, where 0 is Sunday.

## Let's practice!

type: "FinalSlide"
