`@script`
Now that you have your data converted into date format you can go ahead and use it!
In this chapter we are going to explore how to use parts of a date and which parts you can extract. This is going to be a good one!

## Your Timestamps

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ce058e1bbd"
```

`@part1`
A timestamp will have the full date and time elements, however sometimes you might just want to use a specific part of it.

What if you'd like to see your data only 
- by year?
- by day?
- by hour of the day?

## DATE_PART() Function

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "681abd6a95"
```

`@part1`
Dates are very versatile and there's a function that allows you to do just that!

```SQL
DATE_PART(<part to extract>, <timestamp>)
```
Here is an example of the outcome of DATE_PART():

Note: This function returs a number variable, not date.

## All the Date Parts

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "3bdf6d6b62"
```

`@part1`
There are many parts that you can extract out of a timestamp as you see them:
- year
- month
- day
- hour
- minute
- second


`@part2`
There are even others that you may not see but are contained within the original date such as:
- millennium
- century
- decade
- day of the year
- day of the week

## Using DATE_PART()

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d4ccb14fde"
```

`@part1`
Let's look at an example.
If you wanted to take the day of the week out of a date, you could write:

```SQL
SELECT my_timestamp,
DATE_PART('dow', my_timestamp) AS day_of_the_week
FROM my_dates
```

- Notice that the part that you want to extract needs to be in quotes
- The result of a DATE_PART function is a number, not a date

In this case we looked at Day of the Week, and by default they are mapped from 0-6, where 0 is Sunday.
